# Notes App with React and Local Storage

The Notes App is a simple web application built using React, allowing users to create and manage notes or to-do lists that are stored in the browser's Local Storage. The app provides a straightforward and efficient way to jot down important information or tasks and access them even after closing the browser.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Users can easily create new notes or to-do items by typing the content in the provided input area and clicking on the "Add" button.

- **View Notes**: The app displays all the created notes in a list format, showing the title and content of each note.

- **Update Notes**: Users can modify the content of existing notes by clicking on the note they wish to update and making the necessary changes in the editable area.

- **Delete Notes**: The app allows users to delete notes they no longer need, helping them keep the list organized.

- **Local Storage**: The notes created by the user are stored in the browser's Local Storage. So, even if the user closes the browser and opens it again later, the notes will still be accessible.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: The app's front-end is built using the React library, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Local Storage**: The browser's Local Storage is utilized to store the notes. This enables the app to persist data locally without requiring any server or external database.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

4. Launch the development server by running `npm start`.

5. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified).

## Data Storage and Retrieval

- When a user creates, updates, or deletes a note, the app automatically saves the changes to the browser's Local Storage.

- When the app is reopened, it retrieves the notes from the Local Storage and displays them on the screen.

- Note: Local Storage is specific to each browser and device. If the user switches to a different device or clears browser data, the notes will not be accessible.
