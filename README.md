# Student Details App with React and Firebase

The Student Details App is a web application built using React and integrated with Firebase for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for managing and organizing student information effectively.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Users can add new student records by providing relevant details such as name, age, course, and other pertinent information.

- **View Students**: The app enables users to view the list of all registered students with their basic details displayed in a tabular format.

- **Update Student**: Users can easily update the existing student records. They can modify student information like course, age, or any other relevant field.

- **Delete Student**: The app allows users to remove student records from the system, helping to keep the database up-to-date and clean.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: The app's front-end is built using the React library, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **Firebase**: Firebase, a cloud-based platform, is used for data storage and authentication. Firebase Realtime Database is utilized for storing student details, and Firebase Authentication can be incorporated for user authentication if needed.

- **CRUD Operations**: Firebase offers easy-to-use APIs to perform CRUD operations on the database, making data management seamless.
